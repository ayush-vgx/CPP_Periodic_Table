# C++ Periodic Table
A Modern Periodic Table C++ Program

Phew,
Took a little more time then expected, well it is basic one which offers you 3 option:
1. The first one is for Graphical view of the Periodic Table.
2. The second option comes with to search elements via their atomic number (they give a lots of details further by entering atomic number)
   i.e.  Electronegativity, Melting Point, Thermal Conductivity, Discovered By and many more.
3. Well the third option is nothing just a 'exit' option.

Any changes in program would be appreciable.
>__Can add more GUI(s) and can use graphics.h__
